# Fresher Job Prediction Model

## Overview

The **Fresher Job Prediction Model** helps predict the likelihood of fresh graduates securing a job based on their skills, qualifications, and experience. Unlike many existing tools that claim to predict job opportunities for freshers but lack precision, this model focuses on providing accurate predictions using machine learning and real-world data.

## Objective

The model predicts the chances of a fresher getting a job and provides valuable insights into the skills and qualifications that increase employability.
